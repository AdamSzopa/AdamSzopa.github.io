submission stage we now have 11 proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might see in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/&quot;&gt;workboard&lt;/a&gt;, they are in the “Not ready for voting”
column. This is because even though they have successfully been created
according to the template, there is still much to do before the voting starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we are in the Refinement stage, which lasts until August 27th. But
what is the purpose of this stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is to shape each proposal into its best possible version. This is
the moment to work on the proposal with a larger audience, seek feedback and
gather people that would be interested in participating in the Goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/Mascot_konqi-app-utilities.png&quot; alt=&quot;Konqi is ready to work on stuff.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone in the community – newcomers and veterans – to look
through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; and voice your opinions. If you find a proposal that you
like and needs some work, be sure to suggest changes. You can help refine any
number of proposals. If you want to show support for a Goal proposal in a
visible way, each entry should have a “Interest” section at the bottom – you
can add your name there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things to consider when refining the Goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The name of the Goal should be attractive, not very long, and clearly state
what is it about.
It will be easier to vote for a Goal that has clear steps of how it will be
achieved. The more concrete plan is formulated, the better it will look.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ambitious Goals are good, but keep them in the realm of possibility. A
selected Goal will be in focus for the community for ~2 years, the community
expects major parts of the Goal to be completed in that time AND visible
progress to be made on an ongoing basis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And of course, the Goal needs to serve the KDE community :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of that in mind, I again encourage you to look at the current
proposals and &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/&quot;&gt;start refining&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="KDE" /><summary type="html">The process of selecting the new KDE Goals is ongoing, and after finishing the submission stage we now have 11 proposals.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New KDE Goals: submission stage is now open!</title><link href="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2022/06/18/New-KDE-Goals-submission-stage-open.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New KDE Goals: submission stage is now open!" /><published>2022-06-18T14:10:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-06-18T14:10:00+02:00</updated><id>https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2022/06/18/New-KDE-Goals-submission-stage-open</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2022/06/18/New-KDE-Goals-submission-stage-open.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m super excited to finally announce the start of the submission process for the brand new KDE Goals!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, you can submit a new proposal on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/&quot;&gt;workboard&lt;/a&gt; and shape the future direction of the KDE community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stage in the process lasts 4 weeks, but don’t wait until the last moment! Submit early, and use the remaining time to listen to feedback, refine and update the proposal. Only the submission with good descriptions will move to the next stage: the community vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/previous_goals.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of the previous Goals workboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make things easier, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/T15607&quot;&gt;template ticket&lt;/a&gt; is provided that you have to copy and fill out with your content. This way, none of the important parts of a good proposal will be skipped, and there will be consistency between the different proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need an account to create a new proposal, and then use the arrow in the “Not ready for voting” column to create a new task. Don’t forget to copy the description from the template!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, by submitting a Goal proposal, you are also submitting yourself as the Goal Champion for it. A Goal Champion is sort of the face of the Goal and the motivator of the initiative, but not necessarily the one that implements most of the tasks. After all, this is a community Goal, so a good Champion will motivate others to join in and help achieve amazing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the whole process, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/Goals_Process&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait, &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/&quot;&gt;submit your proposal&lt;/a&gt; and who knows, perhaps your idea will be announced as one of the new Goals during &lt;a href=&quot;https://akademy.kde.org/2022&quot;&gt;Akademy 2022&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="KDE" /><summary type="html">I’m super excited to finally announce the start of the submission process for the brand new KDE Goals!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Akademy 2022 Call for Participation</title><link href="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2022/06/10/Akademy-Call-for-Participation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Akademy 2022 Call for Participation" /><published>2022-06-10T12:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-06-10T12:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2022/06/10/Akademy-Call-for-Participation</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2022/06/10/Akademy-Call-for-Participation.html">&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, Akademy is happening this year in Barcelona (and online) in October!

&lt;p&gt;The purpose is to learn what went good, what could’ve gone better and share wisdom to all that are thinking about becoming a new Champion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we start with Niccolò Venerandi. Check it out here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry everyone, it has been &lt;em&gt;a while&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the lack of updates to my blog doesn’t mean that the KDE Goals were also not progressing. On the contrary! Wayland, Consistency and Apps are looking better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I don’t want to talk about the Goals themselves, but rather about the process of selecting new Goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, &lt;a href=&quot;https://akademy.kde.org/2022&quot;&gt;Akademy 2022 has been recently announced&lt;/a&gt;. And because we have a date of the event, it means we can take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/Goals_Process&quot;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt; that is described on the community wiki and determine when the new Goals can be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/akademy2022logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Akademy 2022 logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process says, that 15 weeks before the start of Akademy the submission stage begins. Since this year’s Akademy is held October 1-7, looking at my calendar it means that June 17th should be the start date. That’s soon! But don’t worry, that stage lasts 4 weeks, so if you’d like to submit a new Goal for the KDE community, you still have time to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the submission stage, a refinement stage and voting follow. Check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/Goals_Process&quot;&gt;wiki page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to use the remaining time before mid-June to talk about what makes a good KDE Goal, summarize the current ones, and interview with our Champions about tips for those that would like to take their place. Check the blog for updates on all of that!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="KDE" /><summary type="html">Hello!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">KDE Goals Update – June 2021</title><link href="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2021/06/16/KDE-Goals-June-2021.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="KDE Goals Update – June 2021" /><published>2021-06-16T20:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-06-16T20:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2021/06/16/KDE-Goals-June-2021</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2021/06/16/KDE-Goals-June-2021.html">&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://akademy.kde.org/2021&quot;&gt;Akademy&lt;/a&gt; starts in a few days, and the Champions and I will be focusing on that. However, there are still some interesting updates we’d like to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/akademy2021logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Akademy 2021 logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wayland&quot;&gt;Wayland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With every recent Plasma update (and especially the just released &lt;a href=&quot;https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.22.0/&quot;&gt;version 5.22&lt;/a&gt;) the list of features that are X11 exclusive gets smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, many users may not be aware that the opposite is also happening: every day there are more features available on Wayland that cannot be found on X11!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many resources available describing the security advantages of Wayland over X11, but the ageing protocol has some other shortcomings as well. For example, the last update we highlighted was the recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/718&quot;&gt;VRR support&lt;/a&gt; in 5.22. Among other things, this enables an important use case for me: it allows each of my connected displays to operate at their highest refresh rate. I have a 144Hz main display, but occasionally I plug in my TV, which works at 60Hz. Because of limitations of X11, for everything to work, my main display needs to be limited to 60Hz when both of them are active. But not any more thanks to Wayland!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the KDE developers always try to bring new functionalities to all users, the above example shows that sometimes, either due to X11 limitations or for other reasons, feature parity will not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For different, but similar reasons, some other features that are Wayland exclusive are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Finding stuff using the Global Menu search &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/134&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/134&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting scroll speed factors for input devices &lt;a href=&quot;https://phabricator.kde.org/D28310&quot;&gt;https://phabricator.kde.org/D28310&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting multiple DPIs across different displays&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automatically setting Notifications to “do not disturb” when screencasting &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde/-/merge_requests/33&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde/-/merge_requests/33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stopping applications currently screencasting &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde/-/merge_requests/38&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/xdg-desktop-portal-kde/-/merge_requests/38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be sure that the list of Wayland exclusives will grow and grow as work progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Méven and Vlad will have a Wayland Goal talk at Akademy. Check out the details here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://conf.kde.org/event/1/contributions/5/&quot;&gt;https://conf.kde.org/event/1/contributions/5/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consistency&quot;&gt;Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about consistency, you may think of how different parts of your Plasma desktop should look and behave in a similar way, like scrollbars should all look the same on all windows. Or like when you open a new tab, it should always open in the same place, regardless of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the KDE developers also think about the bigger picture, like: How can we achieve a consistent experience between your desktop and your phone? Here’s where &lt;a href=&quot;https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/&quot;&gt;Kirigami&lt;/a&gt; comes in! It makes sense to have applications like &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.kde.org/neochat/&quot;&gt;NeoChat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/network/tok&quot;&gt;Tok&lt;/a&gt; on both Plasma desktop and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plasma-mobile.org/&quot;&gt;Plasma Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, and, thanks to the Kirigami framework, users will feel at home on both form factors. Now I want to see Kirigami apps on a smartwatch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/neochat_combined.png&quot; alt=&quot;NeoChat desktop and mobile powered by Kirigami&quot; /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NeoChat desktop and mobile powered by Kirigami&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Kirigami, there is work being done on a component called “swipenavigator” to increase its - you guessed it - consistency, among other fixes. Details of the rewrite are in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami/-/merge_requests/310&quot;&gt;merge request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you care about looks? Then you’ll be interested in two MR’s: the first regarding &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/plasma-framework/-/merge_requests/270&quot;&gt;better shadows&lt;/a&gt;, and the other is the “Blue Ocean” style for buttons, checkboxes etc. There are some details at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pointieststick.com/2021/06/11/this-week-in-kde-plasma-5-22-arrives-but-i-bet-youll-want-5-23-once-i-show-you-this/&quot;&gt;Nates blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Consistency Champion Niccolò has a Goal talk during Akademy, so be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://conf.kde.org/event/1/contributions/1/&quot;&gt;watch it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kde-is-all-about-the-apps&quot;&gt;KDE is All About the Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As announced on the community mailing list and the &lt;em&gt;Goals&lt;/em&gt; matrix room, there was a meeting last Monday to discuss the way forward with the huge list of topics mentioned in the previous update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meeting, the conclusion was to start with the topics regarding the different platforms we support, as well as the automation of the build/release process of apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the upcoming Akademy, the topics will be discussed during the BoF sessions. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Akademy/2021/AllBoF&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt; to see when you can attend! Also, don’t miss the “Creating Plasma Mobile apps” BoF!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, like the other Goal Champions, Aleix will have a talk on the first day of Akademy, &lt;a href=&quot;https://conf.kde.org/event/1/contributions/6/&quot;&gt;don’t miss it&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right after the three &lt;em&gt;Goal&lt;/em&gt; talks at Akademy, there will be a&lt;a href=&quot;https://conf.kde.org/event/1/contributions/7/&quot;&gt; KDE Goals round table&lt;/a&gt;, a session where Lydia and I will be joined by the Champions to answer community questions regarding the specific goals, and the goal program as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the event, on Monday June 21st at 18:00 UTC, I will conduct a BoF regarding selecting the next goals! Be sure to join in, if you were thinking about becoming a Champion yourself, or if you’re just curious about the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;

This is the first entry in a hopefully reoccurring series of blog posts about the KDE Goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this series is to provide a frequent update about the Goals, to highlight what cool things are happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, our Goal Champions can still create additional content about their goals in any form they want: short blog posts, videos, in-depth articles, etc. This blog will aggregate that content and also give the champions a way to share quick updates without spending too much time blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that, let’s take a look at the updates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wayland&quot;&gt;Wayland&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plasma 5.22 is coming, and with that a lot of improvements and fixes to Wayland support. Readers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pointieststick.com/&quot;&gt;Nate’s blog&lt;/a&gt; have surely seen many of those highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m very excited about variable refresh rate (FreeSync) support being added. I asked Xaver, author of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/718&quot;&gt;merge request&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/811&quot;&gt;GPU hot-plug&lt;/a&gt; one!) to write about the new features. Hopefully, we’ll get some juicy details soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, you can start testing Plasma 5.22 right now! David has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/plasma-5-22-beta-testing-day/&quot;&gt;post about that&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to report any bugs found and see if the list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland_Showstoppers&quot;&gt;Wayland showstoppers&lt;/a&gt; needs updating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;consistency&quot;&gt;Consistency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niccolo sent over a full list of recent consistency updates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. We are adding a new re-usable component called KHamburgerMenu that will make hamburger menus consistent throughout Plasma. It’s cool because it adapts to your toolbar: if you take an action off it will appear in the hamburger menu, and if you add an action it will disappear from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/system/dolphin/-/merge_requests/168&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/system/dolphin/-/merge_requests/168&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Ark now has a welcome screen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/utilities/ark/-/merge_requests/47&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/utilities/ark/-/merge_requests/47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Gwenview sidebar has been made more consistent with our current humane interface guidelines&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/graphics/gwenview/-/merge_requests/64&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/graphics/gwenview/-/merge_requests/64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Discover now uses standard cards to display reviews instead of custom component&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/discover/-/merge_requests/80&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/discover/-/merge_requests/80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Viewswitcher in libhandy now are more consistent to Plasma style&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/breeze-gtk/-/merge_requests/18&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/breeze-gtk/-/merge_requests/18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. Calendar has been completely redesigned and now uses Plasma style elements more consistently: the top area, the vertical line like in kickoff, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/727&quot;&gt;https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/727&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. Work in progress: we are bringing the highlight from Plasma everywhere on applications as well! A great step forward for our consistency goal of using the same highlight everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MppOSRfFbE8&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MppOSRfFbE8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oof, who knew there’s so much work to do just to stay consistent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kde-is-all-about-the-apps&quot;&gt;KDE is All About the Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a different kind of news, Jonathan has stepped down as the Goal Champion. Thank you very much for all the work done to make KDE a better home for apps, Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Goal’s new champion is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.proli.net/&quot;&gt;Aleix&lt;/a&gt;. He wants to start by asking the community to discuss a range of topics regarding the Goal. Here’s a list from Aleix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;platforms
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;linux
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;flatpak&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;appimage&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;snap&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;distros&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;bsd&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;android&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;windows&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;os x&lt;br /&gt;
??? to discuss: ways to reach the platform, our unique selling points there to focus&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;promo
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;website presence&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;business
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;making money for devs&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;fundraising for KDE&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;suites
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;PIM&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Edu&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Calligra&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;developer story&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plasma
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plasma &amp;amp; apps
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;which apps should be just considered plasma-specific/oriented? what can we leverage from this specificity?&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;what apps are we lacking?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plasma mobile&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plasma desktop (?)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;other form factors: TV, tablet, etc&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech used
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Kirigami and KDE Apps&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;KXMLGUI and KDE Apps&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure we’ll need a couple of meetings to cover all of that! If you’re interested in participating in the discussion of ANY of those topics, please reach out specify which ones. This will help narrow down the focus of the first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’m not actually working on any of the Goals, I do help how I can with the KDE Goals initiative as a whole. This blog is part of that. Additionally, I plan to write a description of the Goal Champion role, since currently we don’t have anything “official”. Let me know if you have ideas about what such a description should include.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="KDE" /><summary type="html">Hello! This is the first entry in a hopefully reoccurring series of blog posts about the KDE Goals.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">KDE Goals – a year lost, a year gained</title><link href="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2021/01/23/A-Year-Lost-A-Year-Gained.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="KDE Goals – a year lost, a year gained" /><published>2021-01-23T15:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-01-23T15:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2021/01/23/A-Year-Lost-A-Year-Gained</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2021/01/23/A-Year-Lost-A-Year-Gained.html">&lt;p&gt;The year 2020 was difficult in many ways, but it also was important for me: I joined KDE e.V. as a consultant in the role of Project Coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main focuses of mine was supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kde.org/goals/&quot;&gt;KDE Goals&lt;/a&gt; initiative, which resulted in creating a formalized &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/Goals_Process&quot;&gt;process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might know (or read in the process), the KDE Goals are to be replaced roughly every two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This timebox was selected to balance keeping the Goals fresh, and letting the Goal Champions have enough time to work on the topics with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, the goals have dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Sprints&quot;&gt;Sprints&lt;/a&gt;, where community members from all over the world meet up to work together – this not only greatly accelerates the work, but also lets the community create a stronger bond (and is a perfect opportunity to take group photos that the Promo team can use later 🙂 ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might guess, the previous year was hardly an ideal one for those kind of events, and even though Virtual Sprints did happen, they can only be a substitute for the in-person ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as the new year started, discussion about a potential extension of the current Goals period began. An extension would mean that instead of starting the process of selecting new Goals this year, we would do that in 2022 instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has two main benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The current goals will get more time to finish the work that is
already ongoing and was somewhat hindered by the pandemic. And if
we’re lucky enough, perhaps by this time next year we could even
think about having a in-person event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The new Goal Champions will start their reign in a (hopefully) more
predictable world, with all of us having a better understanding if
the vaccines will let us travel and meet again. This will help the
Champions set the scope of the Goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are some considerations to be made. As mentioned before, the process assumes replacing Goals with new ones, so that they reflect the current focus of the community. Extending the Goals forever would resolve in a discrepancy between what the community wants, and what the KDE e.V. is promoting and helping with. However, I hope you agree with me that the current Goals (&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/Wayland&quot;&gt;Wayland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/Consistency&quot;&gt;Consistency&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Goals/All_about_the_Apps&quot;&gt;KDE is All About the Apps&lt;/a&gt;) are still very much relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing is, Championing can be a demanding task, so our current Champions might feel exhausted with an extra year in focus. The good news is, after talking with Méven, Niccolo and Jonathan I can confirm that they are ready to extend their roles for an additional year. Additionally, I have confirmed with the KDE e.V. Board that they are OK with this extension as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this brings me to the part, where I can officially announce, that the KDE Goals get an extra year! I hope this will give you more time to &lt;a href=&quot;https://kde.org/goals/&quot;&gt;engage&lt;/a&gt; with the work being done as part of this initiative, and also more time to plan out your Goal proposals for 2022 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS. Speaking of engaging in ongoing work, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.kde.org/Sprints/Wayland/2021Virtual&quot;&gt;Wayland Virtual Sprint&lt;/a&gt; currently active!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="KDE" /><summary type="html">The year 2020 was difficult in many ways, but it also was important for me: I joined KDE e.V. as a consultant in the role of Project Coordinator.</summary></entry></feed>
