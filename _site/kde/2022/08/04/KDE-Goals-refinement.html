    <p>The process of selecting the new KDE Goals is ongoing, and after finishing the
submission stage we now have 11 proposals.</p>

<p>As you might see in the <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/">workboard</a>, they are in the “Not ready for voting”
column. This is because even though they have successfully been created
according to the template, there is still much to do before the voting starts.</p>

<p>Right now we are in the Refinement stage, which lasts until August 27th. But
what is the purpose of this stage?</p>

<p>The point is to shape each proposal into its best possible version. This is
the moment to work on the proposal with a larger audience, seek feedback and
gather people that would be interested in participating in the Goal.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/Mascot_konqi-app-utilities.png" alt="Konqi is ready to work on stuff." /></p>

<p>I encourage everyone in the community – newcomers and veterans – to look
through the <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/">proposals</a> and voice your opinions. If you find a proposal that you
like and needs some work, be sure to suggest changes. You can help refine any
number of proposals. If you want to show support for a Goal proposal in a
visible way, each entry should have a “Interest” section at the bottom – you
can add your name there.</p>

<p>Some things to consider when refining the Goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the Goal should be attractive, not very long, and clearly state
what is it about.
It will be easier to vote for a Goal that has clear steps of how it will be
achieved. The more concrete plan is formulated, the better it will look.</li>
  <li>Ambitious Goals are good, but keep them in the realm of possibility. A
selected Goal will be in focus for the community for ~2 years, the community
expects major parts of the Goal to be completed in that time AND visible
progress to be made on an ongoing basis.</li>
  <li>And of course, the Goal needs to serve the KDE community :)</li>
</ul>

<p>With all of that in mind, I again encourage you to look at the current
proposals and <a href="https://phabricator.kde.org/project/view/322/">start refining</a>!</p>
