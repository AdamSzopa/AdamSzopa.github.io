In case you missed it, Akademy is happening this year in Barcelona (and online) in October! That's so soon!

Do you know what's even sooner? Closing time for the [Call for Participation](https://akademy.kde.org/2022/cfp)!

If you're interested in sharing an interesting topic with the community, you still have until 12th of June 2022 23:59 UTC to submit your proposal.

As a hybrid event, this year's Akademy will accept remote talks, but in person ones are preferred.

Don't wait, check out the [CfP page](https://akademy.kde.org/2022/cfp), and see you at Akademy!
