As part of the preparation for the new round of KDE Goals (as described [last week](https://szopa.org.pl/kde/2022/05/16/KDE-Goals-Process.html)), I'll be interviewing our Goal Champions.

The purpose is to learn what went good, what could've gone better and share wisdom to all that are thinking about becoming a new Champion.

This week we start with Niccolò Venerandi. Check it out here:

Thank you Niccolò! You can find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/veggero/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Niccol%C3%B2Ve).

See you next week with another retrospective!
